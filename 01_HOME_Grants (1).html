    <h1>Grants at the Jacksonville Public Library</h1>

    <div class="quick-actions">
        <h2>Need to:</h2>
        <div class="action-item"><strong>Submit a grant opportunity?</strong> → Use the Grants Intake Form</div>
        <div class="action-item"><strong>Understand the process?</strong> → Read How Grants Work at JPL</div>
        <div class="action-item"><strong>View active grants?</strong> → Check the Grants Pipeline</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Strategic Purpose</h2>
    
    <div class="box">
        <p>Grants enable the Jacksonville Public Library to strengthen services, advance strategic priorities, and respond to community needs beyond what operating funds alone can support. When used thoughtfully, grants support innovation and targeted improvements without compromising long-term stability.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The Library's grants process is intentionally centralized and governed to ensure alignment with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Jacksonville Public Library mission</li>
        <li>Approved Library service priorities</li>
        <li>Operational capacity</li>
        <li>Financial stewardship standards</li>
        <li>Compliance and risk tolerance</li>
        <li>Executive Leadership direction</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This structure protects staff from premature commitments, supports leadership in managing risk, and safeguards the Library's credibility and public trust. Leadership discretion is preserved based on timing and context.</p>

    <div class="box-white">
        <p class="key-principle">A successful grants system advances Library priorities through a manageable portfolio of funded projects without overextending staff or introducing unmanaged financial, operational, or compliance risk.</p>
        <p class="key-principle">The goal is not to pursue more grants, but to pursue the right grants, at the right time, for the right reasons.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Grants Lifecycle at a Glance</h2>
    
    <ol class="numbered-list">
        <li>Grant opportunity identified</li>
        <li>Intake and feasibility review <em>(3-5 business days)</em></li>
        <li>Leadership decision to pursue or decline <em>(within 1 week of review)</em></li>
        <li>Proposal development following approval <em>(timeline varies)</em></li>
        <li>Submission and award decision</li>
        <li>Post-award implementation and reporting</li>
        <li>Grant closeout</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="box">
        <p><strong>Authorization Required:</strong> No proposal drafting, budget development, partner commitments, or funder contact occurs without leadership authorization.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What the Grants Office Does</h2>
    
    <p>The Grants Office serves as the institutional steward for external funding, ensuring grant opportunities are appropriate, feasible, and sustainable before significant staff time is invested.</p>

    <p><strong>The Grants Office:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reviews grant opportunities for eligibility, feasibility, and institutional fit</li>
        <li>Coordinates leadership review and decision making</li>
        <li>Supports high-quality proposal development after approval</li>
        <li>Oversees submission, compliance coordination, and grant closeout</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Role of Grants in the Library Ecosystem</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Grants are most effective when they:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advance priorities already identified by Library leadership</li>
        <li>Strengthen or scale existing services</li>
        <li>Support time-limited initiatives or pilot programs</li>
        <li>Invest in one-time infrastructure or capacity building efforts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Grants are not intended to drive the Library's direction. They are tools used in service of clearly articulated institutional goals.</p>

    <p>Decisions about whether to pursue a grant reflect strategic focus, staffing capacity, timing, and the Library's responsibility to steward public resources wisely.</p>

    <h2>Continuous Learning and Improvement</h2>
    
    <p>The Library's grants process is reviewed periodically to ensure it continues to reflect institutional priorities, operational realities, and lessons learned from experience. This allows the process to remain consistent while adapting thoughtfully as the Library evolves.</p>
